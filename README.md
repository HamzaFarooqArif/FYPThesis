Digital Board Marker is an innovation through technology which focuses on reduc-
tion of resource usage. The system records and live stream the lecture by using
the minimal resources. In Particular, usage of storage media and communication
media is enhanced so that recording and live streaming of lecture seems to be
one hundred times more resource eficient as compared to regular video lectures.
Learning management system is implemented and lectures are managed on it.
Class instructors, students, sketch artists and online lecturers are the end users of
digital board marker. What makes this project unique is, it does not record the
video from camera, it does not compress the video so no compromise on quality,
it does not implement any physical touchpad that makes it ultradurable because
no physical contact with system.
