\section{Literature Review}
This paper presents a technique that aimed to accomplish an efficient balance between video compression using H.265 protocol and retention of 8K resolution. The study implements multi-level of optimization in the encoding process using H.265 where JPEG2000 standards play a crucial role. The study also applies a novel concept of orthogonal projection that manages pixels metadata required in every frame transition followed by motion compensation. By using multiple file formats of 30 video datasets, the outcome of the study is found to be accomplishing approximately 49\% of enhancement in data quality and around 59\% of improvement in video compression in comparison to the existing techniques of HEVC-based video compression.\cite{Murthy2016}
